** How HashMap Works **
>HashMap stores the values in key-value pair and works on the concept of hashing.

# Hashing
> Hashing is a function which generates a unique value using some algorithms and functions. The first and foremost rule of hashing function is it has to generate the same hash always for the same value.

HashMap
* Works on Hashing.
* It uses a hash table for storing the values in key-value pair.
* table is a linked list of key value pair.
* It has two main methods get and put for storing and retrieving the values.
